# PyGating

PyGating is a versatile Python library for building complex gating systems. It's designed to handle various gating scenarios such as feature toggling, access control, and A/B testing, with support for both code-based and JSON-based configurations.

## Features

- **Extensible Framework**: Create custom gates by extending base gate classes.
- **JSON Configuration**: Dynamically configure gates using JSON.
- **Predefined Gates**: Includes `SimpleGate`, `PercentageGate`, `RandomGate`, `InclusionGate`, `OrGate`, and more.
- **Custom Gate Configurations**: Combine gates to create complex gating logic.

## Installation

```bash
pip install pygating
```
